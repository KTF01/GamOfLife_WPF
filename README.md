A WPF implementation of the Game of Life cellular simulation, using the classical rules:
1.	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.	Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.	Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The player can start and stop the simulation with the Return key and step one generation at a time by pressing the space key.
It can be run by using the "dotnet run" command.
